# Wesnoth 2.0, being developed in the Godot Engine.

## How To set up the The Battle for Wesnoth 2.0 Development environment.

This quick guide will walk you through the process of setting up a standard development environment for The Battle for Wesnoth 2.0

### Step 1: Download and “Install” Godot:
Download the latest version of Godot for your Operating System from the Godot website. You will likely want the Standard 64-bit version (The Mono version adds C# support however unless you have a specific need for this the Standard version will suffice.)

The Godot executable does not require installation so you will simply need to extract the exe from the zip file to the location of your choosing.\
Once you have placed the executable in the desired location simply run it to Start Godot.\

Use the Browse button you navigate to the downloaded zip file.   
You will need to create an empty directory to open the project in and navigate to that directory in the “Project Installation Path:” Field. You can tell that the paths are valid by the green checkmark by each field.
